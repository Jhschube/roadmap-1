# Kabanero
Kabanero is an open source project focused on bringing together foundational open source technologies into a modern microservices-based framework. Developing apps for container platforms requires harmony between developers, architects, and operations. Todayâ€™s developers need to be efficient at much more than writing code. Architects and operations get overloaded with choices, standards, and compliance. Kabanero speeds development of applications built for Kubernetes while meeting the technology standards and policies your company defines. Design, develop, deploy, and manage with speed and control!

# Kabanero Foundation

The Kabanero Foundation Instance is a deployment of a Kabanero collection in a specific Kubernetes cluster.  The Kabanero operator is leveraged to install and operate the various curated infrastructure and artifacts as defined by the Kabanero collection.

## Kabanero Foundation in a Kubernetes Cluster Prerequisites 

### Software Installation

- [OKD](https://www.okd.io/) v3.11.0+
- [Operator Lifecycle Manager](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/releases) 0.10.0+


### Cluster Hardware Capacity

The full suite of Kabanero foundation components include: 
  - Istio
  - Knative 
    - Eventing
    - Serving
  - Tekton 
    - Dashboard
    - Pipelines

The default configuration for the Kabanero foundation components require a scheduling capacity of approximately:
  - 6 CPU cores
  - 16GB of memory

Optional Recommended Openshift Components include:

  - [openshift-logging](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/aggregate_logging.html)
  - [openshift-metrics](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/cluster_metrics.html)
  - [openshift-monitoring](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/prometheus_cluster_monitoring.html)

The default configuration for the optional recommended Openshift components with defined resource requests and limits has an upper bound requiring approximately:
  - 3.5 + ( 0.25 * #nodes ) CPU Cores
  - 26GB + ( 1GB * #nodes ) Memory
    - Notably elasticsearch requires a large memory node to schedule on

The following [table](prereq-details.md) illustrates the default container resource requests and limits in a 3 node cluster.

# appsody Application Requirements

## appsody Hardware Capactiy

appsody currently includes 5 different stacks:
  - java-microprofile (249 MB)
  - java-spring-boot2 (269 MB)
  - nodejs (397 MB)
  - nodejs-express (401 MB)
  - swift (472 MB)
  
 Estimated required capactiy for running 10 appsody applications (Assuming roughly 16MB for the application):
  - java-microprofile: **2650 MB**
  - java-spring-boot2: **2850 MB**
  - nodejs: **4130 MB**
  - nodejs-express: **4170 MB**
  - swift: **4880 MB**
